# Phishing-Link-Detection-System
Developed an AI-powered phishing detection system specializing in manual feature extraction and preprocessing to minimize false positives within a team environment.
## 🛡️ Phishing Link Detection System (Deep Learning)

### **📌 Problem**
Phishing attacks remain one of the most significant threats in cybersecurity, where attackers use deceptive URLs to steal sensitive information. Traditional blacklist-based detection methods often fail against newly generated or obfuscated malicious links, necessitating a more dynamic and intelligent approach.

### **💡 Solution**
I collaborated within a **technical team** to develop an AI-powered detection system that classifies URLs in real-time. We implemented a **Hybrid Deep Learning architecture** that leverages:
* **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks):** For extracting structural and spatial features from the URL string.
* **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units):** To capture long-term sequential dependencies and semantic patterns within the text.
* **Manual Feature Engineering:** Integrated specific cybersecurity indicators (e.g., URL length, special characters, and domain analysis) to enhance model robustness.

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**
* **Languages:** Python 🐍
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch / TensorFlow, Keras
* **Data Science:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Tokenization and Sequential Modeling

### **📊 Results & Impact**
* **High Accuracy:** Achieved a peak classification accuracy of **97%**.
* **Reliability:** Significantly reduced **False Positive** rates by combining automated deep learning features with domain-specific manual features.
* **Efficiency:** The system is optimized for high-speed inference, making it suitable for real-time browser integration or email filtering.

### **👥 Teamwork**
As a core member of the development team, I led the **Model Architecture and Feature Engineering** phase, ensuring seamless integration between the data preprocessing pipeline and the neural network layers.
